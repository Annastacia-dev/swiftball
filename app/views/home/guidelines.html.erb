            The questions follow the setlist chronologically. Make your predictions on outfits and surprise songs, with each prediction being worth a certain amount of points. Each correct answer earns you points, and the person with the highest point value wins!

            Surpise song points are based on how you answer the mashup question and points split on the album and song.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 text-sm mt-5">
            Example, if your prediction was a mashup of two songs and you picked two songs each song can earn a maximum of 3 points.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 text-sm mt-5">
            The 3 points will be split into 1.5 for correct album and 1.5 for correct song for the right instrument.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 text-sm mt-5">
            If only the album is correct but on the wrong instrument you get 1 point.

          <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 text-sm mt-5">
            Correct song wrong instrument will still get you full points based on your mashup prediction.

            Something unhinged is considered to be something *planned* by Taylor or her team that is unexpected by the audience and deviates from the regular course of the show. For example: Speak Now TV announcement, Karma MV premiere, vault scramble, etc. Please note that as We am not Taylor and We am not privy to her plans, it is hard to exactly define this and list examples that could fully encompass the scope of unhingedness.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 text-sm mt-5">
            For setlist changes and additions, we operate on a 3 show rule where 1 show is a surprise, 2 shows is a coincidence, and 3 shows is a pattern. After the 3rd show where a setlist item is modified and stays modified, the change is no longer considered unhinged. In short, 1-3 shows are considered unhinged, but the 4th show after a change is no longer unhinged. (For example, Long Live added after SNTV, No Body No Crime with HAIM, and the TTPD setlist.)
