This is a web application based on the Allie fantasy swiftball by [@swiftballers](https://x.com/swiftballers?lang=en).Players make  predictions on outfits and surprise songs for the Eras tour by Taylor Swift.Each prediction is worth a certain amount of points (totaling a maximum perfect score of 113). Each correct answer earns you points, and the person with the highest point value wins!

The current game is played by filling a google form for every show. I built this app as a fun project and to challenge myself and practice my web development skills. It's in no way affiliated to the [allie fantasy swiftball](https://x.com/swiftballers?lang=en).
